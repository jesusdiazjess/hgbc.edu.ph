It's just the place where you stop the story.”<br>— Frank Herbert<p>Dear Stranger,<p>If you are accessing this website, it means that the HGBaquiran College website and its developer FUSASIS have been permanently shut down.<p>Our journey began with great ambition. The website was created to provide a seamless digital platform for students and faculty. It was designed to enhance communication, streamline academic processes, and foster a more connected educational environment.<p>However, as time went on, the weight of challenges grew heavier. Costs increased, resources dwindled, and updates became an uphill battle. Despite our best efforts, the system faltered under the strain, and the dream we built slowly began to crumble.<p>The end arrived not with triumph, but with the quiet resignation of knowing we had done all we could.<p>With sorrow in our hearts, we say goodbye to both the HGBaquiran College website and FUSASIS. Though it was not the ending we envisioned, we are grateful for every moment shared along the way.<p>Sincerely,<br>The FUSASIS Team<p id=contactpoints>To revisit what once was, please visit <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20240703051621/https://jesusdiazjess.github.io/hgbc.edu.ph/index.html rel="noopener noreferrer"target=_blank>Internet Archive</a>.
